/* Extracted from BFQuickMode's inline process() script (Phase 9c step 2b)
   - the signature-pad controller for a bfSignature element. Originally
   emitted once per element with the element's dbId baked directly into
   every function/variable name (bf_signaturePad123, bf_canvas123,
   bf_resizeCanvas123Func, bf_Signature123Reset...), which meant the
   exact same ~50 lines were re-declared for every signature field on a
   form. Rewritten here as a single shared definition keyed by dbId
   (bfSignaturePads[dbId], bfSignatureCanvases[dbId]), called once per
   element via bfSignatureInit(dbId) - see the PHP side for the (much
   smaller) per-element call site. Behaviour is otherwise unchanged,
   including the three-way resize/restore contract: bfSignatureInit's
   own calls pass restoreArg=false (just size the canvas, no restore),
   while the window "resize" handler passes the resize Event object
   (truthy, so the existing drawing is captured and restored across the
   resize) - exactly as the original per-element functions did with
   arguments[0]. The literal "base64" marker used to strip the data URL
   prefix was originally built as 'ba'.'se'.'64' (obfuscated string
   concatenation, presumably to dodge an over-eager hosting malware
   scanner); it is always the constant string "base64" regardless of
   which element renders it, so it's hardcoded directly here rather than
   threaded through as a parameter. Shared by all 4 renderers -
   Classic/Bootstrap/OnePage all had this exact logic including the
   "if (canvas == null) return;" guard; MobileRenderer's per-element
   copy was missing that guard (a latent null-dereference risk if the
   canvas were ever absent, never actually observable on the success
   path since the element always renders its own canvas), so this
   shared version's guard now also protects Mobile - a safety-only
   difference from Mobile's prior behaviour, not a functional one. */
